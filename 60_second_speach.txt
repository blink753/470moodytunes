Hello, we are Moody Tunes

The goal of our project is to match your mood to a set of songs that would be relevant to you.

There are other sites out there that try to accomplish this but what makes our application more relevant is that we will return songs that are recognizable to the user.  

We accomplished this by using the top 300 songs from 14 genres from iTunes.

To get the lyrics we had to crawl azlyrics and we only got kicked out twice! :)

We are using a k nearest neighbor approach and tf-idf to match songs to moods using text analysis. Determing moods and emotions based solely on lyrics is actually an ongoing reserach topic.

We have 5 generic moods to choose from as well as a description box to further define how they feel.  Very rarely do we feel just "happy" it is usually a combination of feelings like happy, loving, and  remenisant.
