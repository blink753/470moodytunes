Every note just wrapped around his soul, From steel guitars to Memphis, all the way to rock and roll.  Ohhh, I can hear 'em playin'. I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol' guitar. Ohhh, I can hear 'em singin', \"Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart.\"  Downtown is where I used to wander. Old enough to get there but too young to get inside. So I would stand out on the sidewalk, Listen to the music playin' every Friday night.  Ohhh, I can hear 'em playin'. I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol' guitar. Ohhh, I can hear 'em singin', \"Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart.\"  Some dreams stay with you forever, Drag you around but bring you back to where you were. Some dreams keep on gettin' better, Gotta keep believin' if you wanna know for sure.  Ohhh, I can hear 'em playin'. I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol' guitar. Ohhh, I can hear 'em singin', \"Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart.\"   Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart.

Tell me, don't I? Or tell me, do I, baby  Give you everything that you ever wanted? Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely? Do I just need to give up and get on with my life? Baby, do I?  Remember when we didn't have nothing But a perfect simple kind of loving? Baby, those sure were the days  There was a time our love ran wild and free But now I'm second guessing everything I see!  Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you baby? Does the sight of me wanting you drive you crazy? Do I have your love? Am I still enough? Tell me, don't I? Or tell me, do I, baby  Give you everything that you ever wanted?

Yeah, we both carry baggage, We picked up on our way, so if you love me do it gently, And I will do the same.  We may shine, we may shatter, We may be picking up the pieces here on after, We are fragile, we are human, We are shaped by the light we let through us, We break fast, cause we are glass. Cause we are glass.  I'll let you look inside me, through the stains and through the cracks, And in the darkness of this moment, You see the good and bad. But try not to judge me, 'cause we've walked down different paths, But it brought us here together, so I won't take that back.  We may shine, we may shatter, We may be picking up the pieces here on after, We are fragile, we are human, We are shaped by the light we let through us, We break fast, cause we are glass.  We might be oil and water, this could be a big mistake, We might burn like gasoline and fire, It's a chance we'll have to take.

Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme. Took off faster than a green light, go, Hey, skip the conversation and you already know. I left a note on the door with a joke we\u2019d made, And that was the first day.  And darling, it was good never looking down. And right there where we stood was holy ground.  Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress, We had this big wide city all to ourselves. We blocked the noise with the sound of \u2018I need you\u2019, And for the first time I had something to lose, Well I guess we fell apart in the usual way. And the story\u2019s got dust on every page, Sometimes I wonder how you think about it now. And I see your face in every crowd.  Cause darling, it was good never looking down. And right there where we stood was holy ground.  Tonight I\u2019m gonna dance for all that we\u2019ve been through. But I don\u2019t wanna dance if I\u2019m not dancing with you. Tonight I\u2019m gonna dance like you were in this room. But I don\u2019t wanna dance if I\u2019m not dancing with you,  It was good never looking down.

In restless dreams I walked alone Narrow streets of cobblestone, 'Neath the halo of a street lamp, I turned my collar to the cold and damp When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light That split the night And touched the sound of silence.  And in the naked light I saw Ten thousand people, maybe more. People talking without speaking, People hearing without listening, People writing songs that voices never share And no one deared Disturb the sound of silence.  \"Fools\" said I,\"You do not know Silence like a cancer grows. Hear my words that I might teach you, Take my arms that I might reach you.\" But my words like silent raindrops fell, And echoed In the wells of silence  And the people bowed and prayed To the neon god they made. And the sign flashed out its warning, In the words that it was forming. And the signs said, The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls And tenement halls. And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.", "title": "the sound of silence"}

Tell me what's your title, America has no more stars, now we call them idols, You sit idle, While we teach prosperity, The first thing to prosper should be inside of me.

Small town hearts of the New Year Brought down by gravity, crystal clear City fog and brave dialogue converge on the frontier Make haste, I feel your heartbeat With new taste for speed, out on the street Find a road to a humble abode where both of our routes meet The silver sound is all around and the colors fall like snow The feeling of letting go, I guess we'll never know  Cheer up and dry your damp eyes and tell me when it rains And I'll blend up that rainbow above you and shoot it through your veins 'Cause your heart has a lack of colour and we should've known That we'd grow up sooner or later 'Cause we wasted all our free time alone  Your nerves gather with the altitude Exhale the stress so you don't come unglued Somewhere there is a happy affair, a ghost of a good mood Wide eyed, panic on the getaway The high tide could take me so far away VCR's and motorcars unite on the Seventh Day A popular gauge will measure the rage of the new Post-Modern Age 'Cause somewhere along the line all the decades align.  We were the crashing whitecaps On the ocean And what lovely sea-side holiday, away A palm tree in Christmas lights My emotion Struck a sparkling tone like a xylophone As we spent the day alone  Cheer up and dry your damp eyes and tell me when it rains And I'll blend up that rainbow above you and shoot it through your veins 'Cause your heart has a lack of color and we should've known That we'd grow up sooner or later 'cause we wasted all our free time alone", "title": "rainbow veins"}

I wish I may, I wish I might Find it in your heart to stick around. I hate it had to end this way Tomorrow is a brand new day And the chances here at love are precious few Someone's out there waiting For a sweet good timing lady To make you smile the way I always wanted to.  Where the wind blows babe, you can bet I'll be riding high with it Holdin' on for my dear life just like I always did.

And bought a parachute at a church rummage sale And with a mean sewing machine and miles of thread We sewed the day above L.A. in navy and red.

And then you yelled as we beheld an old maroon.  Hot air balloon  I'll be out of my mind and you'll be out of ideas pretty soon. So let's spend the afternoon in a cold hot air balloon. Leave your jacket behind. Lean out and touch the tree tops over town. I can't wait to kiss the ground wherever we touch back down.  la la la la la la la la la la la la  We drank the great lakes like cold lemonade. And both got stomach aches sprawled out in the shade. So bored to death you held your breath and I tried not to yawn. You make my frown turn upside down and now my worries are gone.  I'll be out of my mind and you'll be out of ideas pretty soon.

'Cause Hell's broke loose in Georgia and the Devil deals the cards. And if you win you get this shiny fiddle made of gold, But if you lose the devil gets your soul.

Lay me down... Lay me down... Lay me down...  Well it's the story of the two Always on the move.

They drank up all the whiskey and They partied every night Like it could be the last The bounty said shoot on sight. So they chased the endless summer Though it came with the pride. They wouldn't stop running till They found a paradise. But the sheriff finally found them with his eyes seeing red. So the lovers had to shoot him down and fill him full of lead They were finally free To find a place to lay their head And when they finally did he looked at her and then he said.  I said I think that we can stay here, Cause I feel our time has come. And we can walk down to the ocean, And sit with the rising sun. So unpack your bags this instant, No more running from town to town And now that we've arrived so safely, Baby you can  Lay me down... Lay me down... Lay me down... Lay me down...  Well you're my green-eyed girl And I've been running around with you. It's the afternoon and we got nothing left to do. So wipe the dirt off, or Take your shirt off, And we should go hit the cantina, We got work off. I said it's hot outside Let me go swimming in your eyes. We've been running for a while Why don't you lay down and make smile. I could never ask for nothing better than this. It's just tequila and the beach, that's why its salty when we kiss.  I said I think that we can stay here, Cause I feel our time has come. And we can walk down to the ocean, And sit with the rising sun.

Cigarettes and tank of gas, Headed off to nowhere fast, Gotta find a way to make this feeling last.  Cause I believe that I, Was born with a song inside of me. Never question why, I just kept on chasing that melody. And as time goes by, It's funny how time can make you realize, We're running out of it.  On the day that I die, I wanna say that I, Was a man who really lived and never compromised. And when I've lived out my days, Until the very end, I hope they find me in my home, a guitar in my hands. I hope they find me in my home with my guitar in my hands.  Whoa, oh. Whoa, oh.  A part of dawn to be ashamed of, But good people are supposed to be up. But I found peace with the path I took, As I lay down my head. Crossroads you gotta choose, Which way do we win or lose. But every bone in my soul says I sing on through.  Cause I believe that I, Was born with a song inside of me. Never question why, I just keep on singing these melodies. And as time goes by, Its funny how time can make you realize, We're running out of it.  On the day that I die, I wanna say that I, Was a man who really lived and never compromised. And when I've lived out my days, Until the very end, I hope they find me in my home, a guitar in my hands. I hope they find me in my home with my guitar in my hands.  Whoa, oh. Whoa, oh. Whoa, oh. Whoa, oh.  We all go, we all go, It's all over 'fore you know.  I believe that I Was born with a song inside of me.

On the day that I die, I wanna say that I, Was a man who really loved and never compromised.

I let her ride in my Caddy cause I didn't know her daddy was the leader of the Klu Klux Klan. We fucked on the bed, fucked on the flo', fucked so long, I grew a fuckin' afro. Then I fucked to the left, fucked to the right. She sucked my dick 'til the shit turned white. I thought to myself, Sheba, Sheba! Got my ass lookin' like a ZEBRA! I pulled on my clothes and I was on my way, until her daddy pulled up in a Chevrolet. I ran. I jumped out the back window, but her daddy, he was waitin' with a 2 x 4. Oh, he beat me to the left, he beat me to the right. The mutha-fucker whooped my ass all night. But I ain't mad at her prejudiced dad, that's the best damn pussy I ever had.

I took her to my house, cause she was fine, but she whipped out a dick that was bigger than mine. I met this lady from Japan, never made love with an African. I fucked her once, I fucked her twice. I ate that pussy like shrimp fried rice. Don't be amazed at the stories I tell ya. I met a woman in the heart of Australia. Had a big butt and big titties, too, so I hopped in her ass like a kangaroo. See, I met this woman from Hawaii. Stuck it in her ass, and she said, Aiiiiieeee! Lips was breakfast, pussy was lunch, then her titties busted open with Hawaiian Punch. Met Colonel Sander's wife in the state of Kentucky. She said, I'll fry some chicken if you just fuck me.

{"artist": "cake", "lyrics": "Reluctantly crouched at the starting line, Engines pumping and thumping in time. The green light flashes, the flags go up. Churning and burning, they yearn for the cup. They deftly maneuver and muscle for rank, Fuel burning fast on an empty tank. Reckless and wild, they pour through the turns. Their prowess is potent and secretly stearn. As they speed through the finish, the flags go down. The fans get up and they get out of town. The arena is empty except for one man, Still driving and striving as fast as he can. The sun has gone down and the moon has come up, And long ago somebody left with the cup. But he's driving and striving and hugging the turns. And thinking of someone for whom he still burns.   He's going the distance. He's going for speed. She's all alone In her time of need. Because he's racing and pacing and plotting the course, He's fighting and biting and riding on his horse, He's going the distance.   No trophy, no flowers, no flashbulbs, no wine, He's haunted by something he cannot define. Bowel-shaking earthquakes of doubt and remorse, Assail him, impale him with monster-truck force. In his mind, he's still driving, still making the grade. She's hoping in time that her memories will fade. Cause he's racing and pacing and plotting the course, He's fighting and biting and riding on his horse. The sun has gone down and the moon has come up, And long ago somebody left with the cup. But he's striving and driving and hugging the turns. And thinking of someone for whom he still burns.   Cause he's going the distance. He's going for speed. She's all alone In her time of need.

Asking only workman's wages I come looking for a job, But I get no offers, Just a come-on from the whores On Seventh Avenue I do declare, There were times when I was so lonesome I took some comfort there.

When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed With a word she can get what she came for. Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven.  There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure 'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings. In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings, Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven. Ooh, it makes me wonder, Ooh, it makes me wonder.  There's a feeling I get when I look to the west, And my spirit is crying for leaving. In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees, And the voices of those who stand looking. Ooh, it makes me wonder, Ooh, it really makes me wonder.  And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune Then the piper will lead us to reason. And a new day will dawn for those who stand long And the forests will echo with laughter.  If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now, It's just a spring clean for the May queen. Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run There's still time to change the road you're on. And it makes me wonder.  Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know, The piper's calling you to join him, Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know Your stairway lies on the whispering wind.  And as we wind on down the road Our shadows taller than our soul. There walks a lady we all know Who shines white light and wants to show How everything still turns to gold. And if you listen very hard The tune will come to you at last. When all is one and one is all To be a rock and not to roll.  And she's buying a stairway to heaven.", "title": "stairway to heaven"}

He works in the saddle and he sleeps in the canyons, waiting for summer, his pastures to change. And as the moon rises he sits by his fire, thinking about women and glasses of beer. And closing his eyes as the doggies retire, he sings out a song which is soft but it's clear as if maybe someone could hear...  Goodnight you moon light ladies, rock-a-bye sweet baby James. Deep greens and blues are the colors I choose, won't you let me go down in my dreams? And rock-a-bye sweet baby James.  Now the first of December was covered with snow and so was the turnpike from Stockbridge to Boston. Though the Berkshires seemed dreamlike on account of that frosting, with ten miles behind me and ten thousand more to go. There's a song that they sing when they take to the highway, a song that they sing when they take to the sea, a song that they sing of their home in the sky, maybe you can believe it if it helps you to sleep, but singing works just fine for me.  So, goodnight you moon light ladies, rock-a-bye sweet baby James. Deep greens and blues are the colors I choose, won't you let me go down in my dreams?

You told me you loved me, so why did you go away? Away.   I do recall now,  the smell of the rain fresh on the pavement.  You ran off the plane.  That July ninth, the beat of my heart it jumped through my shirt.  Hope you still feel my arms.  Now I'll go sit on the floor,  wearing your clothes.  All that I know is I don't know how to be something you miss.  I never thought we'd have a last kiss,  I never imagined we'd end like this.  Your name, forever the name on my lips.   I do remember the swing in your step.  The life of the party, you're showing off again.  And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in. I'm not much for dancing, but for you I did.  Because you love my handshake, meeting your father. Said he loved how I walk with my hands in my pockets,  how I'd kiss you when you were in the middle of saying something.  I pray that you still miss those rude interruptions.   Now I'll go sit on the floor, wearing your clothes.   All that I know is that I don't know how to be something you miss.  I never thought we'd have a last kiss,  I never imagined we'd end like this.  Your name, forever the name on my lips.  So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep,  and I'll feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe.  And I'll keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are.  Hope it's nice where you are.  And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day,  and something reminds you, you wish you had stayed.  I never planned on making you cry,  but not letting go would be living a lie.   So I'll go sit on the floor,  wearing your clothes.  All that I know is I don't know how to be something you miss.

It took me four days To hitch-hike from Saginaw. \"I've come to look for America.\"  Laughing on the bus, Playing games with the faces, She said the man in the gabardine suit Was a spy.  I said, \"Be careful, His bow tie is really a camera.\" \"Toss me a cigarette, I think there's one in my raincoat.\" We smoked the last one An hour ago.  So I looked at the scenery, She read her magazine; And the moon rose over an open field. \"Kathy, I'm lost\", I said, Though I know she was sleeping. \"I'm empty and aching and I don't know why.\"  Counting the cars On the New Jersey Turnpike The've all come To look for America, All come to look for America, All come to look for America.", "title": "america"}

But these handprints on the front steps are mine. And up those stairs, in that little back bedroom is where I did my homework and I learned to play guitar. And I bet you didn't know under that live oak my favorite dog is buried in the yard. I thought if I could touch this place or feel it this brokenness inside me might start healing. Out here its like I'm someone else, I thought that maybe I could find myself if I could just come in I swear I'll leave. Won't take nothing but a memory from the house that built me. Mama cut out pictures of houses for years. From 'Better Homes and Garden' magazines. Plans were drawn, concrete poured, and nail by nail and board by board Daddy gave life to mama's dream. I thought if I could touch this place or feel it this brokenness inside me might start healing. Out here its like I'm someone else, I thought that maybe I could find myself. If I could just come in I swear I'll leave. Won't take nothing but a memory from the house that built me. You leave home, you move on and you do the best you can.

How About The One Where You Don't Get Your Way? But Even If You Do, That's Okay. So What Game Shall We Play Today? How About The One Where You Don't Get Your Way? But Even If You Do, That's Okay. Try to pick it up, reading the signs, It's turning out to be a real good time, And who'd have thought that entertainment, Lies in the winter of your discontent. Now, sit at the table, face to face, Queen takes pawn, check or checkmate! I feel your foot brush against my leg, I'm not that easily led. You flutter your eyes and you toss your hair, I have to say that it is kind of unfair, Let me tell you baby now what's in store, You win the battle, but I'll win the war! This has been fun, I suppose, Although my feelings are all juxtaposed, But truth be told, I'm as fickle as hell, But gentlemen never kiss and tell! ", "title": "get your way"}

If I never loved I never would have cried. I am a rock, I am an island.  I have my books And my poetry to protect me; I am shielded in my armor, Hiding in my room, safe within my womb.

You can go to extremes with impossible schemes. You can laugh when your dreams fall apart at the seams. And life gets more exciting with each passing day. And love is either in your heart, or on it's way.  Don't you know that it's worth every treasure on earth To be young at heart. For as rich as you are, it's much better by far To be young at heart.

Have I been good to you at all? Oh I'm so tired of playing these games We'd just be running down The same old lines, the same old stories of Breathless trains and, worn down glories Houses burning, worlds that turn on their own  So we don't eat until your father's at the table We don't drink until the devil's turned to dust Never once has any man I've met been able to love So if I were you my friend, I'd learn to have just a little bit of trust", "title": "we don't eat"}

Maybe this is wishful thinking, Probably mindless dreaming, But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right.  I'd go back in time and change it but I can't.

Because I don't know That's when she said I don't hate you boy I just want to save you while there's still something left to save That's when I told her I love you girl But I'm not the answer for the questions that you still have  But the day pressed on like crushing weights For no man does it ever wait Like memories of dying days That deafen us like hurricanes Bathed in flames we held the brand Uncurled the fingers in your hand Pressed into the flesh like sand Now do you understand?  So tell me now If this ain't love then how do we get out? Because I don't know That's when she said I don't hate you boy I just want to save you while there's still something left to save That's when I told her I love you girl But I'm not the answer for the questions that you still have  1000 miles away There's nothing left to say But so much left that I don't know We never had a choice This world is too much noise It takes me under It takes me under once again I don't hate you I don't hate you, no  So tell me now If this ain't love then how do we get out? Because I don't know That's when she said I don't hate you boy I just want to save you while there's still something left to save That's when I told her I love you girl But I'm not the answer for the questions that you still have  I don't hate you I don't hate you, no", "title": "savior"}

And the wonder of it all Is that you just don't realize how much I love you.  It's time to go home now and I've got an aching head, So I give her the car keys and she helps me to bed.

I know my heart will never be the same,  but I'm telling myself I'll be okay. Even on my weakest days, I get a little bit stronger.  Doesn't happen over night, but you turn around and a months gone by,  And you realize you haven't cried. I'm not giving you a hour or a second or another minute longer. I'm busy getting stronger.  And I'm done hoping that we can work it out, I'm done with how it feels, spinning my wheels Letting you drag my heart around. And ohhh I'm done thinking, that you could ever change.

The sky was bruised, the wine was bled, and there you led me on.  In your house I long to be; Room by room, patiently,  I'll wait for you there, like a stone. I'll wait for you there, alone. Alone.  And on I read, until the day was gone; And I sat in regret, of all the things I've done; For all that I've blessed, and all that I've wronged. In dreams until my death, I will wonder on.

Tell me again was it love at first sight When I walked by and you caught my eye. Didn't you know love could shine this bright? Well smile because you're the deer in the headlights.  Met a girl with a graceful charm, But when beauty met the beast he froze. Got the sense I was not her type By black eye and bloody nose, But I guess that's the way it goes.  Tell me again was it love at first sight When I walked by and you caught my eye. Didn't you know love could shine this bright? Well smile because you're the deer in the headlights.  It's suffocating to say, But the female mystique takes my breath away. So give me a smile or give me a sneer, 'Cause I'm trying to guess here.  Tell me again was it love at first sight When I walked by and you caught my eye. Didn't you know love could shine this bright? I'm sorry I ever tried, deer in the headlights.  Tell me again was it love at first sight When I walked by and you caught my eye. Didn't you know love could shine this bright? If life was a game, you would never play nice. If love was a beam, you'd be blind in both eyes. Put your sunglasses on 'cause you're a deer in the headlights.  You're the deer in the headlights.

{"artist": "barbra streisand & michael crawford", "lyrics": " Night-time sharpens, Heightens each sensation . . . Darkness stirs and wakes imagination. Silently the senses abandon their defenses Helpless to resist the notes I write For I composed the music of the night!   Slowly, gently Night unfurls its splendor. Grasp it, sense it tremulous and tender.   Hearing is believing, music is deceiving, Hard as lightning, soft as candle light,   There you trust the music of the night...   Close your eyes, For your eyes will only tell the truth,   And the truth isn't what you want to see. In the dark it is easy to pretend That the truth is what it ought to be...   Softly,   Deafening,   Music shall caress you.   Hear it,   Feel it,   Secretly posses you... Open up your mind, let your fantasies unwind, In this darkness which you know you cannot fight, The darkness of the music of the night...  Close your eyes start a journey through a strange new world Leave all thoughts of the world you knew before! Close your eyes and let music set you free!  Only then can you belong to me...  Floating (floating), falling (falling) Sweet intoxication! Touch me (touch me), trust me (trust me) Savour each sensation!  Let the dream begin, Let your darker side give in To the power of the music that I write, The power of the music of the night!   Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah... Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah... Ah-ah-ah... Aaaaaaaaaah...oooh...   You alone can make my song take flight, Help me make the music of the night...   Help me make the music of the night...", "title": "the music of the night"}

Preachers on the podium speaking of saints. Prophets on the sidewalk begging for change. Old ladies laughing from the fire escape, Cursing my name.  I gotta a basket full of lemons and they all taste the same, A window and a pigeon with a broken wing, You can spend your whole life working for something, Just to have it taken away.  People walk around pushing back their debts, Wearing paychecks like necklaces and bracelets, Talking about nothing, not thinking about death, Every little heartbeat, every little breath.  People walk a tightrope on a razors edge. Carrying their hurt and hatred and weapons. It could be a bomb, or a bullet, or a pen, Or a thought, or a word, or a sentence.  There ain't no reason things are this way. Its how they've always been and they intend to stay. I don't know why I say the things I say, But I say them anyway.  But love will come set me free. Love will come set me free, I do believe. Love will come set me free, I know it will. Love will come set me free, yes.  Prison walls still standing tall. Some things never change at all. Keep on building prisons, gonna fill them all. Keep on building bombs, gonna drop them all.  Working your fingers bare to the bone. Breaking' your back, make you sell your soul. Like a lung, it's filled with coal, Suffocating slow.  The wind blows wild and I may move. But politicians lie and I am not fooled. You don't need no reason or a three piece suit, To argue the truth.  The air on my skin and the world under my toes Slavery stitched into the fabric of my clothes Chaos and commotion wherever I go, Love I try to follow.  Love will come set me free Love will come set me free, I do believe Love will come set me free, I know it will Love will come set me free, yes  There ain't no reason things are this way.

Tell her to make me a cambric shirt: Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme; Without no seams nor needle work, Then she'll be a true love of mine.  On the side of a hill a sprinkling of leaves. Washes the grave with silvery tears. A soldier cleans and polishes a gun. Sleeps unaware of the clarion call.  Tell her to find me an acre of land: Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme; Between the salt water and the sea strand, Then she'll be a true love of mine.  War bellows blazing in scarlet battalions.

The son was an ok guy, They had a pet dragonfly. The dragonfly it ran away, But it came back with a story to say.  Her dirty paws and furry coat, She ran down the forest slope. The forest of talking trees, They used to sing about the birds and the bees. The bees had declared a war, The sky wasn't big enough for them all. The birds, they got help from below, From dirty paws and the creatures of snow.  And for a while things were cold, They were scared down in their holes. The forest that once was green Was colored black by those killing machines. But she and her furry friends Took down the queen bee and her men. And that's how the story goes, The story of the beast with those four dirty paws.", "title": "dirty paws"}

You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad. But I think that it's best if we both stay.  Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers, that took all of their problems out on me. But you carry my groceries, and now I'm always laughin'. And I love you because you have given me no choice but to:  Stay, stay, stay. I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time. You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad. But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay.  You took the time to memorize me: my fears, my hopes, and dreams.

I want something else, to get me through this  Semi-charmed kinda life, baby, baby  I want something else, I'm not listening when you say good-bye  The sky was gold, it was rose  I was taking sips of it through my nose  And I wish I could get back there, someplace back there  Smiling in the pictures you would take  Doing crystal myth, will lift you up until you break  It won't stop, I won't come down  I keep stock with the tick-tock rhythm, I bump for the drop  And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given  Then I bumped again, then I bumped again  I said...  How do I get back there, to the place where I fell asleep inside you  How do I get myself back to the place where you said...  I want something else, to get me through this  Semi-charmed kinda life, baby, baby  I want something else, I'm not listening when you say good-bye  I believe in the sand beneath my toes  The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling  I believe in the faith that grows  And the four right chords can make me cry  When I'm with you I feel like I could die  And that would be all right, all right  And when the plane came in, she said she was crashing  The velvet it rips in the city, we tripped on the urge to feel alive  Now I'm struggling to survive, those days you were wearing that velvet dress  You're the priestess, I must confess  Those little red panties they pass the test  Slide up around the belly, face down on the mattress  One  And you hold me, and we're broken  Still it's all that I wanna do, just a little now  Feel myself, head made of the ground  I'm scared, I'm not coming down  No, no  And I won't run for my life  She's got her jaws now, locked down in a smile  But nothing is all right, all right  And I want something else, to get me through this life  Baby, I want something else  Not listening when you say...  Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye  Good-bye  The sky was gold, it was rose  I was taking sips of it through my nose  And I wish I could get back there  Someplace back there, in the place we used to start  I want something else", "title": "semi-charmed life"}

Before we work I gotta get this off, See the other family members and drop gifts off.

Where does christmas go,&quot; they asked &quot;And what does christmas do?&quot; Now children have such simple requests Their wishes are so small That the young man saw no reason why He could not grant them all They liked his stories so much They begged him not to let it end So he told them about the wizards of winter Whose winter ball they must attend How these wizards decorated their whole world With icicles, frost and snow And how with the dreams of this night beneath it It all would magically start to glow And the snow seemed to obey the young man's every gesture In the cold december's air And as for the wizards' imperial ball Well, they were already there", "title": "wizards in winter"}

I am a rock, I am an island.  I've built walls, A fortress deep and mighty, That none may penetrate. I have no need of friendship; friendship causes pain. It's laughter and it's loving I disdain. I am a rock, I am an island.  Don't talk of love, Well, I've heard the word before. It's sleeping in my memory. I won't disturb the slumber of feelings that have died. If I never loved I never would have cried. I am a rock, I am an island.  I have my books And my poetry to protect me; I am shielded in my armor, Hiding in my room, safe within my womb. I touch no one and no one touches me. I am a rock, I am an island.  And a rock feels no pain; And an island never cries.", "title": "i am a rock"}

Well, if you're thinkin' bout getting me a present this year, let me put a bug in your cute little ear, How bout two tickets to a tropical shore, where we don't have to wear these winter clothes anymore, instead of turkey we'll have mahi-mahi grill, and Pina Coladas in the blender chillin'..  All I want for Christmas is a real good tan, take me to the Islands put my feet in the sand, rockin' to and fro with the rhythm of the ocean, singin Silent Night with the palm trees ablowin'..  Ooooo, don't you think it's a pretty good plan?(its a real good plan) All I want for christmas is a real good tan..  Well everybody's praying for a Christmas so white, come to think about it, that'd be alright, as long as it's sand and not snow on the ground, and everyday our skin gets a little more brown, We'll string some lights in a coconut tree, I'll rub some oil on you, and you can rub some on me..  All I want for Christmas is a real good tan, I can see us baby on the beach hand in hand, rockin' to and fro with the rhythm of the ocean.. Baby won't you say you and me we'll be going? Ooooo, I can almost feel my toes in the sand,(my toes in the sand) All I want for Christmas is a real good tan..  Don't worry baby, we'll celebrate plenty, I'll buy you some shades and a brand new bikini.. We won't have to worry about the holiday rush, it'll be you and me fallin' deeper in love..  Ooooo, don't you think it's a pretty good plan?(its a real good plan) All I want for christmas is a real good tan..

And why does what I want always take so long ? Please tell me where does God live And why won't He talk to me ?  I'd say, Grandma what is love ? Will I ever find out ? Why are we so poor, what is life about ? I wanna know the answers before I fall off to sleep.  She sort of smiled as she tucked me in. Then she pulled up that old rockin' chair once again. But tonight she was slightly, remarkably Different somehow  Slowly she rocked, lookin' half asleep. Grandma yawned as she stretched. Then she started to speak. What she told me, would mold me, and hold me Together inside.  She said all the things you ask You will know someday. But you have got to live in a patient way. God put us here by fate And by fate that means better days.  She said, child we are all moons in the dark of night. Ain't no morning gonna come 'til the time is right. Can't get to better days lest you make it through the night. You gotta make it through the night, yes you do.  You can't get to no better days Unless you make it through the night. Oh, you will see those better days But you gotta be patient. (Be patient) oh baby, be patient.  Later that year, at the turn of spring, Heaven sent angels down and gave Grandma her wings. Now, she's flying, and sliding, and gliding In better days  And although I'm all grown up I still get confused. I stumble through the dark Getting bumped and bruised. When night gets in my way I could still hear my Grandma say I can hear her say, I can hear her say.  (Be patient) You can't get to no better days Unless you make it through the night baby.

Where does christmas go,&quot; they asked &quot;And what does christmas do?&quot; Now children have such simple requests Their wishes are so small That the young man saw no reason why He could not grant them all They liked his stories so much They begged him not to let it end So he told them about the wizards of winter Whose winter ball they must attend How these wizards decorated their whole world With icicles, frost and snow And how with the dreams of this night beneath it It all would magically start to glow And the snow seemed to obey the young man's every gesture In the cold december's air And as for the wizards' imperial ball Well, they were already there", "title": "wizards in winter"}
